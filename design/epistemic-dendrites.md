# Epistemic Dendrites

**An algorithmic philosophy for visualizing knowledge claims.**

---

## The Philosophy

Knowledge grows like neural tissue. A claim is not a static proposition but a living structure—branching from premises, reaching toward implications, accumulating evidence at its terminals. The dendrite does not announce its meaning; it embodies it through form.

**Correctness as Vitality.** Claims with high correctness scores pulse with warmer, more saturated color—the green of healthy tissue. Lower correctness shifts toward the amber and rust of uncertainty, not as error but as incompleteness. The color does not judge; it indicates metabolic state.

**Confidence as Depth.** High confidence enables deeper branching—the claim has been explored, its implications traced further into conceptual space. Low confidence produces sparser structures, tentative gestures that haven't yet found their full form. Depth is earned through investigation.

**Dependencies as Gravity.** Claims that depend on many premises grow more branches from their base—multiple root structures feeding a single synthesis. The number of incoming connections shapes the density at the origin. Isolated claims stand alone; networked claims cluster.

**Evidence as Stippling.** At the terminals of each branch, where knowledge meets the unknown, small accumulations of dots suggest the evidence gathered there. More evidence produces denser stippling. This is the Cajal technique: building form through patient accumulation of small marks.

## The Algorithm

The generative process follows organic logic:

1. **Seeding**: Hash the claim ID to produce deterministic randomness. Each claim always generates the same structure—reproducible but unique.

2. **Branching**: From the center, extend primary branches at angles distributed around the origin. The number of primary branches = 3 + (dependency count × 2). Each branch carries initial thickness proportional to overall confidence.

3. **Recursion**: At each branch terminal, spawn 1-2 child branches at randomized angles within a spread cone. The spread widens with higher correctness (confident claims explore more territory). Recursion depth = 2 + floor(confidence / 2).

4. **Tapering**: Branch thickness diminishes by 0.65× at each level. Line weight at terminals approaches single-pixel thinness—the Cajal quality of lines that know where they're going, tapering as they reach their destination.

5. **Curves**: Branches are not straight lines but subtle bezier curves. Noise perturbation adds organic wobble without destroying directionality.

6. **Stippling**: At branch terminals, scatter small dots in a radius proportional to evidence count. Dot density = evidence entries × 3. Each dot is placed with slight random offset, building texture through accumulation.

7. **Fade**: Opacity decreases toward terminals, creating depth. Closer branches are more opaque; distant ones fade like structures receding into fog.

## Visual Language

The resulting forms should feel:
- **Organic but precise**: Hand-drawn quality with mathematical underpinning
- **Subtle not overwhelming**: The art supports the claim, doesn't dominate it
- **Consistent yet unique**: Same claim always produces same structure, but each claim is distinct
- **Cajal-inflected**: Tapering lines, stippled density, sepia-adjacent tones

The art does not illustrate the claim's content. It visualizes its epistemic properties—how well-supported, how confident, how connected. A viewer familiar with the system reads the structure intuitively; others simply see beautiful organic forms that feel appropriate to scientific contemplation.

## DAG Visualization: Tree Rings and Connectors

The claims DAG extends the dendrite philosophy to network visualization. Inspired by radial Perlin noise and tree ring patterns (see [gorillasun.de](https://www.gorillasun.de/blog/radial-perlin-noise-and-generative-tree-rings/)).

### Organic Nodes

Each node is an organic ellipse generated by 2D noise sampling:

```javascript
// Sample noise at actual (x,y) coordinates along ellipse circumference
const n = noise2D(baseX * resolution, baseY * resolution, seed);
// Radial displacement creates smooth, gravitational wobble
coords.push({
    x: baseX * (1 + n * amplitude),
    y: baseY * (1 + n * amplitude)
});
```

**Concentric rings** radiate outward from each node at scales [1.0, 1.15, 1.3, 1.45]. Each ring:
- Has its own noise variation (seed offset)
- Fades in opacity toward outer edge
- Fill follows organic shape (painted outside-in)

### Ring-Based Connectors

Connectors "plug into" specific rings, creating visual coherence:

- **Strand count** = confidence-based (1-4 strands)
- **Each strand connects to a different ring** (strand 0 → core, strand 3 → outermost)
- **Opacity matches ring opacity** — inner strands more prominent
- **Shared opacity function** between nodes and connectors

### Highlighting System

Selection highlighting preserves ring hierarchy:

**Nodes:**
- Selected: opacity 1.0
- Connected: opacity 0.6
- Dimmed: opacity 0.3

**Connectors (when highlighted):**
```javascript
const ringFactor = 1 - ringIndex * 0.3; // 1.0, 0.7, 0.4, 0.1
opacity = 0.15 + ringFactor * 0.75;     // 0.9, 0.68, 0.45, 0.23
strokeWidth = 0.4 + ringFactor * 1.0;   // 1.4, 1.1, 0.8, 0.5
```

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `resolution` | 0.08 | Noise field smoothness |
| `amplitude` | 0.07 | Max radial displacement |
| `ringScales` | [1.0, 1.15, 1.3, 1.45] | Concentric ring sizes |
| `ringOpacity(i)` | 0.5 × (1 - i/4) | Fade toward outer rings |
| Core ring stroke | 0.8px, opacity × 0.7 | Subtler than outer rings |
