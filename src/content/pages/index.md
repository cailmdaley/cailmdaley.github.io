I'm an observational cosmologist studying gravitational lensing to map dark matter and constrain cosmology. My work spans the cosmic microwave background and optical galaxy surveys, and I'm a member of the Euclid, SPT-3G, and UNIONS collaborations. Currently a postdoc at CEA Paris-Saclay in the CosmoStat laboratory, funded by the [TOSCA project](https://tosca.cosmostat.org/).

I'm increasingly drawn to questions at the intersection of AI and scientific practice. Machine systems are beginning to produce faster than humans can verify—a challenge that touches both alignment and epistemology. Some early notes on building democratic infrastructure for machine-speed science [here](/science-ai).
