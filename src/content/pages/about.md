I grew up in West Virginia. I did my bachelor's at Wesleyan University, studying physics and continental philosophy and doing circumstellar disk research with ALMA.

For my PhD at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign I shifted to cosmology, working on CMB lensing with the South Pole Telescope. I also helped run Astronomy on Tap and First Discoveries, an early childhood science education program.

After finishing in 2024 I moved to Paris for the TOSCA project at CEA Paris-Saclay, which focuses on cross-correlations between optical and radio surveys. I've since expanded into kinematic lensing and CMB × galaxy work.
