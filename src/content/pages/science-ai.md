subtitle: What happens when machinic scientific output exceeds human verification?
mode: blended
demoIntro: "AI systems like <a href='https://astropilot-ai.github.io/DenarioPaperPage/'>Denario</a> and <a href='https://edisonscientific.com/articles/announcing-kosmos'>Kosmos</a> promise scientific output at unprecedented rates. Both acknowledge requiring human verification; neither suggests epistemological frameworks or infrastructure for it. The graph below began as a way to structure verification in my own cosmology research—claims as nodes, dependencies as edges, evidence and uncertainty as metadata. The structure tries to make a project traversable by AI systems while defining nodes for human attention. It doubles as an argument about AI-mediated science."
